    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix. Crispy tacos, and tender, mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this impressive meal. This recipe takes a little time but it's so worth it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Dried chile peppers: The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat, don't remove all the seeds.</li>
        <li>Seasonings: You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon, cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
        <li>Beef: Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done, the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
        <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.</li>
    </ol>
